# CARoadmap
## Motivation
On my Group Ironman I am hard stuck on the hard tier bracket. I need to find the most efficient route to get to the elite tier bracket.
## Problem
Looking through each boss and different tasks could get tiresome and overwhelming.
## Solution
I want to be able to give a nice list of combat achievement tasks for the player to complete. This would give the player a sense of progress and a clear objective. I plan on using a machine learning algorithm to find the most optimal route to get to a reward tier. Expected output would be a list of combat achievement tasks for the player to follow.

Algorithm will account for these data points:
- Wise Old Man api for efficiency rates to rate KILL_COUNT tasks
- Web scrape OSRS WIKI to get Completion Percentage of tasks
